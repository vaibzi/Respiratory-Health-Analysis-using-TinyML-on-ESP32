Steps:
-> Install Edge Impulse CLI

-> Train and Test the model using EdgeImpulse based on the given dataset.

-> Setup ESP32 Dev board on Arduino IDE and make the breadboard connections to the mic if no inbuilt mic

-> Import the Arduino code from Edge Impulse

-> Upload the files and observe serial monitor after compilation

Alternatively, the Tensorflow model has been given in the repository as a subsitute for EdgeImpulse
Although, a lot of troubleshooting would be required with the Arduino IDE libraries as they throw error from time to time, based on the current library versions.
